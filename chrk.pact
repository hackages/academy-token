; The CHRK token is the governance and rewards token for Charkha. As described
; in the white paper, this token is a standard KIP-0005 token with some unique
; properties we'll encode in this contract:
;
; - 1 CHRK accrues per market per block
; - The maximum supply of CHRK is 10 million, after which distribution stops
; - CHRK can be claimed by users dependent on their market participation
;
; CHRK is much more than a simple fungible token. To implement these extra
; properties we are going to need to refer to data in our other contracts,
; such as an account's collateral (as recorded in the Charkha controlling
; contract). However, our other contracts also refer to CHRK, since it is itself
; one of our lending markets.
;
; In this module we will implement the CHRK token and use _module references_
; to refer to the interfaces of the other contracts we rely on. Comments will
; focus on the unique properties of CHRK aside from its use as a fungible
; token; for a full set of comments and tests focused on the fungible-v2
; interface please see the KETH contract and REPL tests.
